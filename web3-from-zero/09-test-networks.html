<title>Web3 From Zero - Lesson 9</title>

<h1>9. Test Networks</h1>

<p>
  Building software requires you to test before you release. The usual development process goes from
  running things on your local computer, to running it on a test system, to running it on the
  production system.
</p>

<p>
  This process also holds true for Web3 development. You install a local blockchain network on your
  own machine to test the basic functionality of your smart contracts and later you deploy the
  system onto a test network, to make sure it still works togeher with many other smart contracts
  you might use in your application.
</p>

<p>
  Test networks enable testing on real infrastructure without spending real tokens, and in turn,
  real money. A TX on the Ethereum network can easily cost $10, so when you're just testing and
  sending hundreds of TXS a day, this can get costly quick! With free test tokens that's not an
  issue anymore.
</p>

<p>
  Also, if you accidentally push a development key to a public repository, you won't lose anything 
  but the worthless test tokens you put on that address.
</p>

<p>
  This is why you had to copy a private key in the previous lesson. You need an address you can
  reuse so you can get tokens on it and spend them for gas or to do transactions that require
  payment.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> We will go into the details of gas costs later. This lesson is just about connecting
  to a test network and getting our first tokens!
</blockquote>

<h2>Connecting to a Test Network</h2>

<p>
  In Part I of this course, you learned how to use providers to connect to a blockchain network. You 
  simply called the <code>ethers.getDefaultProvider</code> method and got a provider to read data
  from the chain. 
</p>

<p>
  The default provider connects, by default, to the Ethereum main network. Which is the production 
  environment of Ethereum. If you want to connect to a test network, you have to use the first
  parameter of that method. In our case it will be <code>"goerli"</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> Görli is one of Ethereum test networks, Ethers.js knows about it, so we can simply
  use the name. For other networks that are compatible with Ethers.js, you need more configuration.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The code is similar to the last lesson, but this time, I want you to call <code>getChainId</code>
  to ensure you're connected to the test network. The correct ID is <code>5</code>.
</p>

<code-editor>
// Write your code here!

<p>
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(
  "0x350690562a6c31051d2c9f085e0b91be0a4ac0a3c206998c89ff3cfedf3524d0"
)

const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider("goerli")

const connectedWallet = wallet.connect(provider)

const chainId = await connectedWallet.getChainId()

print(chainId)
</p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Getting Test Tokens</h2>

<p>
  Now that you know how to connect to a test network, we will go back to the question why I asked 
  you to copy a private key and address.
</p>

<p>
  On blockchain networks you have to pay for writing actions, which means sending transactions. If 
  you send an TX from an address that doesn't own enough of the networks native token, your TX won't 
  get executed. So, if you create random private keys for development all the time, they will never
  have any tokens to pay for anything. 
</p>

<p>
  To fix this, you create one or more private key for development, load them up with tokens, and 
  use them to pay for your TXS. While you have to buy tokens on the main network, you can get them
  for free from a token faucet.
</p>

<p>
  A faucet is a website, where you enter the address of your development account, and it will send
  you test network tokens for free.
</p>

<p>
  Choose one of the following faucets to request test tokens for the address that belongs to the 
  private key you copied in the last lesson.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" target="_blank">Alchemy Faucet</a> requires a (free)
    Alchemy account
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/" target="_blank">Paradigm Faucet</a> requires a
    Twitter account
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your choosen faucet accepted your request, you want to check out if it worked and you got your 
  tokens. You can do this in multiple ways. One is to go on
  <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/" target="_blank">Etherscan</a>, a blockchain explorer,
  enter the address you used in the faucet and search for it. 
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> Etherscan is a search engine for addresses. Everything on-chain is public and you can
  browse it freely.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The second way is to check the balance programmatically with Ethers.js. So, try it yourself. 
  Connect to the Görli testnet, and call the <code>getBalance</code> method on your wallet. It is 
  asynchronous and returns a <code>BigNum</code>.
</p>

<code-editor>
// Write your code here!
<p>
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(
  "0x350690562a6c31051d2c9f085e0b91be0a4ac0a3c206998c89ff3cfedf3524d0"
)

const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider("goerli")

const connectedWallet = wallet.connect(provider)

const balance = await connectedWallet.getBalance()

print(`${connectedWallet.address} owns ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)} ETH`)
</p>
</code-editor>

<p>
  If everything went correctly, the balance of your address should be higher than <code>0</code>. 
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  In this lesson you learned what tests networks are and how they fit inside your development 
  processes. Main networks are the production environment of blockchain networks, and test networks
  are, well, the test environments.
</p>

<p>
  You also learned that these test networks come with their own test tokens and how to request them 
  from one of the multiple faucets out there.
