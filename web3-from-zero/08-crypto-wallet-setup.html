<h1>8. Crypto Wallet Setup</h1>

<p>
  We know how public key cryptography works, even if just in essence. We know that a EOA is a
  blockchain address that is controlled by the holder of a related public/private key pair. But how
  come crypto wallets into play?
</p>

<h2>What is a Crypto Wallet?</h2>

<p>
  A crypto wallet, or simply wallet, is a mechanism to manage your keys, some are even able to
  manage your blockchain connections.
</p>

<p>
  There are different types of wallets, so let's get a small overview on the essentials.
</p>

<h3>1. Wallet App</h3>

<p>
  A wallet app is a dedicated application that manages your keys and blockchain connections. Some 
  can connect to different types of blockchains, some only understand one specific blockchain 
  network.
</p>

<p>
  Since a wallet app is software, it comes with the danger of being hacked if it's installed on a 
  device that has an internet connection.
</p>

<p>
  MetaMask is probably the most popular wallet app for the Ethereum network. You can enter your keys
  into it, or even let it generate keys for your with a seed phrase. It allows you to add and remove
  RPCs for different chains, and comes preconfigured with Ethereum mainnet and it's test networks.
</p>

<p>
  To connect a wallet app with a Web3 app, you either need a browser extension that links the wallet 
  you installed on your PC or Mac with the browser or, if you're using the mobile version, you need 
  to scan a QR code displayed on the Web3 app.
</p>

<h3>2. Paper Wallet</h3>

<p>
  A paper wallet is simply a piece of paper with all your keys, addresses, or your seed phrase
  written down. It can't do much, since it's not software, but at least you don't have to remember 
  all this information on your own. 
</p>

<p>
  With a paper wallet you can't send any tokens, but if you tell people one of the addresses you 
  written on it, you can at least receive them.
</p>

<p>
  Also, it can't get hacked online, because it can't be connected to the internet. This makes 
  paper wallet quite safe. Depending on the material of the wallet and the risk of burglaries in 
  your location, it can be susceptible to other problems. Also, like everything else, you can simply 
  lose it.  
</p>

<h3>3. Hardware Wallets</h3>

<p>
  Hardware wallets are devices that store your keys, addresses, and seed phrases. They keep your 
  private keys always on the device and never make them public. If you need to sign a message with a 
  private key, you have to send the message to the wallet and it will respond with the signature.
</p>

<p>
  Hardware wallets have standardized interfaces and work in tandem with wallet apps. So, you can see
  them as an extension of a wallet app that makes it more secure.
</p>

<h3>4. Programmatic Wallet</h3>

<p>
  Since all these digital wallets talk to each other and DApps via standardized interfaces, it might
  not come as a surprise that there is an API for this.
</p>

<p>
  What a software library is to an app, is a programmatic wallet to an wallet app. It's just a piece 
  of software that is controlled with code; no UI, no CLI, just code.
</p>

<p>
  Ethers.js offers such a programmatic wallet with its concepts of Singers, which are an abstraction
  over different account types. One of them is <code>Wallet</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Wallet</code> is a class you can create an object from that works directly with an RPC. This
  way you can actually write something on the blockchain without installing additional software!
</p>

<h2>Recap of the Blockchain Network Connection</h2>

<p>
  In Part 1 of this course, we talked about how crypto wallets form a layer between your browser and
  the blockchain network of your choice. Figure 1 shows where a wallet is usually located in the 
  stack.
</p>

<p>
  The blockchain connection with wallet part of the image shows that the wallet handles the 
  connection to the RPC, and the browser doesn't know anything about it.
</p>

<p>
  As you just learned, Ethers.js can work as a wallet too! So, we can connect to a RPC with
  Ethers.js and also use it to sign transactions, which are the mechanism to write on the
  blockchain.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Development Key</h2>

<p>
  If you're developing with a blockchain, never use private keys that control addresses with your 
  personal assets on it! Create one or more development keys, via a seed phrase or the random key
  generator of Ethers.js. 
</p>

<p>
  If you have to do transactions in development that require tokens, be it for deployments or simply 
  to test your code, you need to save the keys somewhere for later use. If you don't need any tokens
  for an action, you can just take a new random <code>Wallet</code> every time. 
</p>

<p>
  The following example creates a random <code>Wallet</code> every time you run it. Copy one of the 
  private keys and use it as your development key.
</p>

<code-editor>
  const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
  print(wallet.privateKey)
</code-editor>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> You shouldn't copy your private keys around and save them in an insecure way, but
  since a development key doesn't have any tokens, it's not a problem if it gets stolen. Just create
  a new one and delete the old one if that happens.
</blockquote>

<h2>Using a Development Key</h2>

<p>
  Let's use that key! Try to construct a new <code>Wallet</code> object, pass it your copied private
  key from above, and print the public key and address it generates. 
</p>

<p>
  Also, copy the address, so you have it handy for the later lessons.
</p>

<code-editor>
// Write your code here!
<p>
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(
  "0x350690562a6c31051d2c9f085e0b91be0a4ac0a3c206998c89ff3cfedf3524d0"
)

print(wallet.publicKey)
print(wallet.address)
</p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Connecting a Wallet with a Provider</h2>

<p>
  Now, that you can create wallets from an existing private key, let's try to connect a wallet to a
  provider.
</p>

<p>
  To establish a connection the wallet object offers a <code>connect</code> method which will create
  a new wallet that is connected to the provider.
</p>

<p>
  Try to create a connected wallet and use it's <code>getGasPrice</code> method to check if the 
  connection works. Keep in mind that this method is asynchronous, and the price will be a
  <code>BigNum</code> object.
</p>

<code-editor>
// Write your code here!
<p>
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(
  "0x350690562a6c31051d2c9f085e0b91be0a4ac0a3c206998c89ff3cfedf3524d0"
)

const connectedWallet = wallet.connect(ethers.getDefaultProvider())

const gasPrice = await connectedWallet.getGasPrice()

print(ethers.utils.formatEther(gasPrice) + " ETH")
</p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  In this lesson, you learned about different types of wallets, and that you can use a programmatic 
  wallet for development. This way, you don't have to install any additional software. 
</p>

<p>
  You also learned how to connect a wallet with a provider, which will be important for the
  following lessons. As I said before, you need a wallet to send transactions to a blockchain
  network.
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="09-test-networks.html">the next lesson</a>, you will learn about test networks and how
  to request test tokens from token faucets.
