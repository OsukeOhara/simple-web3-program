<h1>1. Reading Address Data</h1>

<p>
  Addresses are the bread and butter of blockchain networks. What IPs are for the Internet,
  addresses are for the blockchain. Addresses point to smart contracts and externally owned
  accounts (EOAs).
</p>

<p>
  An address number of the length of 20 bytes build from a public key and is usually shown as 40 hex
  digits. They look something like this <code>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note: </b>An address is used to send and receive data or money, in the form of tokens. Your
  money is gone when you send tokens to the wrong address because of a fault. Always check you have
  the correct address. <b>No one can help you to get your money back!</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
  An EOA is an address controlled by a private/public key pair owner from outside the Ethereum
  network; thus, the name <b>externally</b> owned account. Usually, you use a crypto-wallet to
  manage keys and addresses.
</p>

<p>
  A smart contract is software running on the nodes (computers) that make up the blockchain network.
  The owner of a smart contract can be another smart contract or an EOA. That's why a smart contract
  isn't externally owned.
</p>

<p>
  These addresses, both smart contracts and EOAs, have data tied to them. The Ethereum blockchain
  stores this data, and you can read and write it if you have the right permissions. In this lesson,
  you will just read data. As you can see in Figure 1, you can't write on the blockchain without a
  crypto-wallet.

<h2>Reading the Transaction Count of an Address</h2>

<p>
  To read data, you need an Ethers.js provider but also an address. Let's start with the transaction
  (TX) count. It's a simple number stored on the blockchain for every address that was part of such
  a TX. Ethereum adds 1 to the number if another TX with that address happens.
</p>

<p>
  Ethers.js providers offer a <code>getTransactionCount</code> method that returns a promise that 
  resolves to a TX count, so you have to <code>await</code> it.
</p>

<p>
  Try it out in the editor! Call the method and <code>print</code> its output. The method expects an
  address as <code>string</code> argument, so here a few you can use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Developer DAO NFT Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xdd00Cc906B93419814443Bb913949d503B3DF3c4</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    GitCoin MultiSig Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Vitalik Buterin EOA:<br>
    <code>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<code-editor>
  const address = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
  // Write your code here!
  <p>
    const transactionCount = await provider.getTransactionCount(address)
    print(transactionCount)
  </p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Reading the Balance at an Address</h2>

<p>
  Reading the balance of an address is a bit harder than reading the TX count.
</p>

<p>
  Smart contracts and EOAs, have an Ether balance, the native money or the <b>native token</b> of
  the Ethereum network. Ether is what you have to pay to do TXs on the Ethereum network.
</p>

<p>
  Using a provider's <code>getBalance</code> method, you can read the Ether balance of an address.
  Again, this method returns a promise, so you have to <code>await</code> it.
</p>

<p>
  Try it out in the editor! Call the method and <code>print</code> its output. The method expects an
  address as <code>string</code> argument, so here a few you can use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Developer DAO NFT Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xdd00Cc906B93419814443Bb913949d503B3DF3c4</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    GitCoin MultiSig Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Vitalik Buterin EOA:<br>
    <code>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<code-editor>
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
  // Write your code here!
  <p>
    const balance = await provider.getBalance(
      "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
    )
    print(balance)
  </p>
</code-editor>

<p>
  We got the balance, but why does it look like that?
</p>

<h2>The BigNumber Type</h2>

<p>
  Ethers.js wrapped the balance in its own <code>BigNumber</code> type, because the number can be
  too big for JavaScript's <code>Number</code> type to store. You have to change the balance to a
  <code>string</code> with the right number of decimal points to display it in a clear way.
</p>

<p>
  One of the biggest things that make Ethereum different from JavaScript are number types. For a
  long time, every number was of type <code>Number</code> in JavaScript, which is a double-precision
  (64bit) floating-point . Every number <b>was</b> stored like that, because some time ago it got a
  new number type called 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt" target="_blank">
  <code>BigInt</code></a> for very large integer numbers.
</p>

<p>
  Everything is an integer number in Solidity, the language used to make smart contracts for
  Ethereum. Solidity is concerned with money, and floating-point has problems that can cost you
  money, so they went for integer numbers only. Solidity always stores numbers as integers, and the
  most used type is <code>uint256</code> (also known as <code>uint</code>) which can store 78
  decimal digits. JavaScript's <code>Number</code> type can only store 16 digits. 
</p>

<p>
  Tokens can have more than 16 digits, so they're too big for <code>Number</code>. Addresses are
  also stored as integers and are 20 byte big (40 hex digits). 20 byte are 160 bit, so they don't
  fit into the 64 bit <code>Number</code> type either. That's why you use a <code>String</code> to
  store addresses in JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  Since Ethers.js wants to keep working with older browsers that don't support  <code>BigInt</code>,
  they made their own integer type called <code>BigNumber</code>. It comes with
  <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/bignumber/#BigNumber--methods" target="_blank">
  methods for basic arithmetics</a>, but can also be converted to <code>String</code> or
  <code>BigInt</code> when needed.
</p>

<h2>Converting to a Readable Format</h2>

<p>
  The last exercise gave you a <code>BigNumber</code> object that isn't easy to understand. While
  it's enough to work with the value inside of our code, you should change it to a 
  <code>String</code> before you show it to a user.
</p>

<p>
  To do so, you can use
  <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/display-logic/#display-logic--functions"> utility
  functions</a> Ethers.js includes. The <code>formatUnits</code> function will automatically convert
  a <code>BigNumber</code> to a <code>string</code> with the right decimal points. Which is handy to
  display a balance to a user.
</p>

<p>
  Try to convert the <code>BigNumber</code> to a <code>string</code> and <code>print</code> it!
</p>

<p>
  The <code>formatUnits</code> function can be found in the <code>ethers.utils</code> object. This
  time it returns the output right away, so no <code>await</code> needed.
</p>

<code-editor>
  const address = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
  const balance = await provider.getBalance(address)
  // Write your code here!
  <p>
    const readableBalance = ethers.utils.formatUnits(balance) + " ETH"
    print(readableBalance)
  </p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  In this lesson, you learned that addresses are the heart of the Ethereum blockchain and point to
  externally owned accounts and smart contracts.
</p>

<p>
  Addresses are 160 bits or 20 bytes integer numbers usually shown as 40 hex digits, and JavaScript
  can't store them in its <code>Number</code> type because it's only 8 bytes big. The same is true
  for token balances, which can have more than the 16 digits a <code>Number</code> could store.

  In <a href="02-connect-to-contracts.html">the next lesson</a>, you will learn how to use smart
  contracts from the frontend.
